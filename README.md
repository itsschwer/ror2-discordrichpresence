Adds Discord Rich Presence functionality to Risk of Rain 2.

## Features
- Displays the current stage's icon, name, and subtitle, the currently selected difficulty, the currently selected character, and the current run time.
- Has a unique presence for different menu states (currently idling in the menu, choosing a character, and reading the logbook).
- Other unique presences depending on the game status.

A plethora of options are provided to fine-tune the presence settings, such as whether or not to show the currently fought boss, the teleporter charge status, include a custom menu idle message, and more. [Risk of Options](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options/) provides a nice UI for interacting with this! (Otherwise, it can be found at `BepInEx/config/com.cuno.discord.cfg`)

**Mod creators**: if you would like to add your map or character's image to the presence, contact me at the user found below.

If you experience any issues or have any suggestions, please contact me! I can be found on the RoR2 Modding Discord server, as `mikhailmcraft`.
